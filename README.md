# The Webre

This is my personal website / blog using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), [Talwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) & [React Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome/).

## The Starter

This project was created using the [Gatsby Markdown Typescript Personal Website](https://gatsby-markdown-typescript-personal-website.netlify.app/) Starter. I liked the theme, and was really interested in learning some Typescript so, it seemed like a good fit.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Gatsby**

    Make sure you have installed the Gatsby CLI.

    ```shell
    yarn global add gatsby-cli
    ```

2.  **Develop**

    Navigate into the root folder and execute the following command:

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`

3.  **Build**

    Get an optimized production build for your site generating static HTML and JavaScript, CSS bundles.

    ```shell
    gatsby build
    ```

4.  **Serve**

    Starts a local server for testing your production site.

    ```shell
    gatsby serve
    ```

    Your production site is now running at `http://localhost:9000`

## Deploy
